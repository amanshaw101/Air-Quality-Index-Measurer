# Air Quality Index Measurer

## 📌 About the Project
The **Air Quality Index Measurer** is a machine learning-based project designed to predict air quality levels using regression techniques. It analyzes environmental factors and provides an accurate Air Quality Index (AQI) score, helping users assess pollution levels in a given region. 

## 🚀 Features
- **Predicts Air Quality Index (AQI)** based on environmental parameters.
- Utilizes **Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression** for enhanced accuracy.
- **Data visualization** for insightful analysis of air pollution trends.
- **User-friendly interface** for inputting environmental data and obtaining AQI predictions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (for backend logic and data processing)
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (for model training and evaluation)
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy (for handling datasets)
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn (for graphical representation of air quality trends)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for model development and experimentation)
